      <h2>Impacts of Climate Changes on Species and Communities</h2>
      <p>
        The rapid climate change we are experiencing today poses a major threat
        to earth’s biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Climate change is
        expressed in overall warming, increase in the frequency of extreme
        weather events (for example heat waves or intensifying storms), and in
        the oceans also sea level rise and acidification. The biota in Levant
        Basin (the eastern part of the Eastern Mediterranean) is potentially one
        of the most sensitive marine regions to climate change. This is because
        the Levant is the southeastern edge (trailing) of distribution of most
        Mediterranean and Atlanto-Mediterranean species. The coastal water
        conditions are naturally extreme, being the hottest, saltiest, and
        having the lowest primary productivity in the Mediterranean. The
        temperature range of sea surface temperature (SST) on the Israeli coast
        (at the southeastern corner of the Levant basin) in the 1970-90 was
        about 15-29 °C. However, satellite data analysis suggested an increase
        of almost 1°C in the eastern Mediterranean SST between 1985-2006 (re
        analyzed from http://www.coastalwarming.com). More recent analysis of
        temperatures measured in-situ >50 kms offshore the Israeli coast,
        suggested a 3°C SST warming between 1980-2013. In such a
        naturally-extreme environment that is becoming more extreme, native
        species may be more vulnerable to stress, which can trigger population
        collapses and possibly extirpations. On the other hand, warming can be
        an advantage for warm-loving alien species, such as those invading from
        the Red Sea through the Suez Canal.
