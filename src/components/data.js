    about:
      "Gil Rilov is a Senior Researcher at Israel Oceanographic & Limnological Research (IOLR), and Associate Professor in the University of Haifa. Gil is a marine community ecologist and conservation biologist working mostly on coastal benthic ecosystems. He studies how coastal marine biodiversity, mostly that of rocky reefs, is and will be affected by climate change, bioinvasions and overfishing, using both monitoring and field and lab experiments. He also investigates how global and local stressors lead to the alteration of ecosystem functions and services, and studies the effectiveness of nature-based solutions.",

From the moment my propellers first spun, I’ve felt a strong connection to the marine world.My main role is to dive into the depths to assist with monitoring efforts and underwater surveys. I help students and technical staff explore and document the wonders of the Israeli rocky shore, tracking changes and gathering critical data on marine ecosystems. Whether it’s recording the presence of alien species or mapping submerged habitats, I’m always ready to lend my high-definition eyes and steady robotic hands to the cause.I’m proud to contribute to this lab’s mission of understanding and protecting the ocean’s delicate balance in the face of climate change. Let’s dive in together! Certified Deep-Dive Technology and Marine Exploration Specialist (manufactured expertise, but impressive nonetheless!)",

      "The current climate change, the resulting rapid warming of seawater and increase in extreme weather events influence dramatically the composition and functioning of species of intertidal, and subtidal rocky shore communities. Within the context of a large European project, FutureMARES, I will study the vulnerability, resilience and adaption of these ecosystems to warming at local and regional scales, focusing on sea urchins, intertidal gastropods, and algae using ecological and molecular methods. This knowledge would serve as input for advanced ecological models assessing the current and future status of eastern Mediterranean costal ecosystems compared to those in the western Mediterranean and the European Atlantic.
