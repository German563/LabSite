    about:
      "My research explores the patterns, dynamics, and processes that shape marine communities, especially rocky shores and subtidal reefs. I am interested in the structure of communities and what affects their diversity, including larval recruitment, species interactions (predator-prey, competition, facilitation), overfishing, bioinvasions, climate change. I also study how marine communities function and what ecosystem services they provide. I am investigating nature-based solutions designed to protect these fascinating communities, their functions, and services (including Blue Carbon) through, for example, marine protected areas. So far, I have been fortunate to conduct research on the shores of Israel (Mediterranean and Red Sea), the USA, New Zealand, Brazil, Chile, South Africa, Crete, Cyprus, and Italy (Ischia). I have worked on rocky shores, subtidal reefs, coral reefs, and seagrass. I am also a Professor in the Marine Biology Department at the Leon H. Charney School of Marine Sciences at the University of Haifa. I teach a marine ecology course there.",
