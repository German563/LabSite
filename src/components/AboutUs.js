        Marine Community Ecology Lab(the Rilov Lab): As part of the Marine
        Biology Department at IOLR in Haifa, Israel, our lab studies diverse
        aspects of marine community ecology and conservation.Our focal study
        systems are coastal benthic communities, mostly rocky shores and
        subtidal rocky reefs, but we are also involved in research on seagrass
        ecology, as well as sea turtle and shark population ecology and
        conservation.We study the patterns and dynamics of biodiversity on rocky
        reefs, and the processes that shape them, including recruitment, species
        interactions, bioinvasions and climate change.We also study the impacts
        of overfishing and conversely, marine reserves, on benthic communities,
        and attempt to assess the ecosystem services the marine systems provide
        along the Israeli Mediterranean and Red Sea shores.We do our
        investigations by a combination of field surveys and monitoring, and
        field and lab experiments.One of our biggest challenges is to describe
        and understand the understudied, fast - changing, benthic communities on
        reefs of the Levant shores, and specifically its unique intertidal
        vermetid reefs.{" "}
